# Emergency-Health-Service
## Description
An emergency health service is  an android application designed for the onsite doctor who 
needs  to  know  the  history  of  the  patient  by  just  entering  the  patient’s  contact  number.  The 
patient data comes preloaded with the application. The patient registers to the application by 
providing  it’s personal details along with contact number and email address. A welcome email 
gets sent as soon as the patient registers in the application.  Similarly, the application requires 
doctor to be registered too. In case of a  doctor, the application needs the location where the 
doctor  is  currently  employed.  The  patient  can  login  into  the  system  by  its  username  and 
password. Once the patient gets logged in, patient can view  its  details. Similarly, doctor needs 
to enter it’s credentials to enter into the system. Once, the doctor is authenticated, the doctor 
enters contact number of the patient which the doctor receives from the 911 officer. Once the 
doctor enters the  contact number, all the patient history gets loaded into a  list view which the 
doctor can view and plan the medication to be given to the patient. Once the doctor is with the 
patient, the doctor sends a text message to the emergency contacts that the patient has set. 
The message contents the location of the hospital at which, the ambulance is taking.
